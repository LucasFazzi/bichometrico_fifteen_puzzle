# bichometrico_fifteen_puzzle

Game I am developing for Bichometrico (link: https://bichometrico.com); The main code was a Coder-Dojo script (original file is inside repository) shared by a guy I didn't remember the name and put into a Facebook forum; I added some modifications to sync between screens and some additional effects I will add in the future; I kept the movement of the pieces using Tween Node like original code, which I think it was a brilliant technique.

Feel free to use everything, including Sprites.
