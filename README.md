# bichometrico_fifteen_puzzle

Game I am developing for Bichometrico (link: https://bichometrico.com); The main code was used with a Coder Dojo script (original file repository is inside repository) that a guy I didn't remember the name and shared into a f√≥rum, with some modifications I made to sync between screens and some additional effects I will add in the future; I kept the movement of the pieces using Tween Node like original code, which I think it was a brilliant technique.

Feel free to use everything, including Sprites.
