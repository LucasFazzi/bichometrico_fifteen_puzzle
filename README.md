# bichometrico_fifteen_puzzle

Game that I am developing for Bichometrico (link: https://bichometrico.com); The main code was a Coder-Dojo script (link: https://github.com/programaths/coder-dojo-godot); I added some modifications to sync between screens; some additional effects I'm adding too; I kept the movement of the pieces using Tween Node like original code, which I think it was a brilliant solution.

Feel free to use everything, including Sprites. 


PS: i made in this bizarre screen format to facilitate the tween move

UPDATE: 
I changed the screen orientation and added collision border to the pieces; So you can change the orientation of the project screen as you like, just reverse the directional commands in the Tile Script INPUT to the order that works, as well as play on the PC itself with a functional Screen Portrait.
