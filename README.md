# bichometrico_fifteen_puzzle

Game I am developing for Bichometrico (link: https://bichometrico.com); The main code was a Coder-Dojo script (link: https://github.com/programaths/coder-dojo-godot); I added some modifications to sync between screens and some additional effects I will add in the future; I kept the movement of the pieces using Tween Node like original code, which I think it was a brilliant technique.

Feel free to use everything, including Sprites.
